# Company name:  GHopper (see logo)
Ghopper is an e-commerce company founded in 2018 by two Community College graduates.  The company began as an online site selling returned, slightly-used electronic components and equipment, mostly to hobbyists.  GHopper remains an e-commerce company selling a wider range of popular electronics and has expanded globally.  It is a data-forward company that continues to improve customer satisfaction by tracking customer metrics such as refund rates, loyalty program response and fulfillment times.  

#  My role as a Data Analyst is to provide:  
1) Responses to stakeholders' questions based on an analysis of customer data. 
2) Feedback regarding gaps in the provided customer data. 
3) Observations that have come about from having a close relationship with the data.

# Business Questions Addressed:
  As part of my analysis, I investigated the following key business questions using GHopper's customer data, for 2019 to 2022. (link to customer data ERD)  
  1) What were the overall trends in sales during this time? (link)
  2) Where were our monthly and yearly growth rates? (link)
  3) How is the new loyalty program performing?  Should we keep using it? (Link)
  4) What were our refund rates and average order value? (link)

    
# How is the loyalty program performing and should we keep using it?
Notes: To determin how the loyalty program is performing, I compared two metrics: a) the USD prices and b) number of purchases for each group. 
1. Before analysis I removed entries where USD price is listed as $0. (Qty: 158 entries out of 108095 total)
2. And I removed entries where USD price is blank (Qty: 27 entries out of 108095)
3. Number of Loyalty entries = 45686, number of Non-loyalty entries = 62276. Both groups have same order of magnitude entries.
