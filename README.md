###  Company Background
GHopper is an e-commerce company founded in 2018 by two Community College graduates.  The company began as an online site selling returned, slightly-used electronic components and equipment, mostly to hobbyists.  GHopper remains an e-commerce company selling a wider range of popular electronics and has expanded globally.  It is a data-forward company that continues to improve customer satisfaction by tracking customer metrics such as refund rates, loyalty program response and fulfillment times.  

###  As a Data Analyst for GHopper I am responsible for:   
- Answering stakeholder questions through analysis of customer data.
- Identifying gaps and limitations in the datasets provided.
- Sharing insights and observations developed from close engagement with the data.

### Stakeholder's Questions Addressed:
  I investigated the following 3 key business questions using GHopper's customer data for 2019 to 2022. ([Excel customer data](images/Elist_Data_clean_GitHub.xls) & [ERD](images/eList_Excel_ERD.png))  
  1. [What were the overall trends in sales for 2019 to 2022?](#1-what-were-the-overall-trends-in-sales-for-2019-to-2022)
  2. [What were our refund rates?](#2-what-were-our-refund-rates)
  3. [How is the new loyalty program performing against average order value (AOV)? Should we keep using the program?](#3-how-is-the-new-loyalty-program-performing-against-average-order-value-aov-should-we-keep-using-the-program)
     
### 1. What were the overall trends in sales for 2019 to 2022?  
Below is a plot of total sales per year globally. 
<p align="left">
<img width="70%" height="70%" alt="image" src="images/Total_sales_per_year_globally_v3.JPG" />
</p>

- From 2019 to 2020 total sales increased by 163%. Note that 2020 was during the depths of the COVID pandemic  and the plot appears to reflect consumer spending during the stay-at-home directive. 
- This was followed by a drop in sales from 2021 to 2022 back to a baseline value of ~$4 million total sales. 
- Excluding pandemic-driven anomalies in 2020 and 2021, spending from 2019 to 2022 appears flat.
- Depending on the performance of 2023 sales, there may be a need to reinvigorate sales, perhaps through  stronger incentives programs, new product offerings, and a more impactful online presence. 

The following plot shows similar regional sales trends.   

<p align="left">

</p>

- All regions show sales peaks at years 2020 and 2021.
- North America consistently dominated, generating nearly twice the sales of the next largest region, EMEA. 


### 2. What were our refund rates?
The plot below shows global refund rates per product line.

<p align="left">
<img width="70%" height="70%" alt="image" src="images/Global_refund_rates.JPG" />
</p>

- For the years 2019 to 2022, the refund rates for all products remained below the industry benchmark for e-commerce sales.
- Laptops accounted for the highest percentage of refunds, with the Macbook Air and ThinkPad showing  almost identical refund rates.
- This suggests a potential need for a deeper investigation into the laptop category.
- Key questions to explore: were returns driven by performance dissatisfaction or by product defects? 
- If performance-related, offering alternative laptop models may reduce refund rates.
- If defect-related, production may want to strengthen their quality control checks prior to shipment.    

### 3. How is the new loyalty program performing against average order value (AOV)? Should we keep using the program?
The plot below shows the AOV aggregated into loyalty and non-loyalty customers.  

<p align="left">
<img width="70%" height="70%" alt="image" src="images/AOV_loyalty_program.JPG" />
</p>

- On average, loyalty customers' purchasing behavior showed little change, with order sizes remaining flat from 2019 through 2022.
- Non-loyalty customers show a brief uptick in 2020 but then reverted back to pre-COVID levels.
- This pattern aligns with the overall sales trend: excluding pandemic years (2020 - 2021), purchasing behavior has remained stable.
- Recommendation: extend the loyalty program for another year to collect additional data and confirm whether purchasing behavior remains steady.
