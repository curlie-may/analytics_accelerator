**CTE format
WITH cte_name (column1, column2, ...) AS (
    -- Query that defines the CTE
    SELECT ...
    FROM ...
    WHERE ...
)
-- Main query
SELECT ...
FROM cte_name;
----------------------------------------
WITH: Initiate the CTE definition
cte_name: The name assigned to the CTE (used to reference it later).
Optional column list: Specifies column names for the CTE’s result set.
Main query: References the CTE by name, treating it like a normal table.
----------------------------------------
**Example

Step 1: Write the base query
We start by writing the basic SELECT query:
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Salary
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > 50000;

Step 2: Wrap the query using the WITH keyword to create a CTE
Use the WITH keyword to give the CTE a name.
WITH HighEarningEmployees AS (
    SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Salary
    FROM Employees
    WHERE Salary > 50000
)

Step 3: Use the CTE in the main query
Finally, refer to the CTE in a SELECT statement by calling the CTE name defined above.
WITH HighEarningEmployees AS (
    SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Salary
    FROM Employees
    WHERE Salary > 50000
)
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName
FROM HighEarningEmployees;
